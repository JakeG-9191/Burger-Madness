# Burger-Madness
Burger Madness is an application that allow the user view a list of burgers that have been devoured or are available for consumption by the user. 

## Application Information
Burgers that have been eaten can be reclaimed by clicking on the appropriate button, while those that are available to eat can be eaten by also clicking on the appropriate button. 

Once the corresponding button has been clicked for either, the burger is then moved into the other category where a new button is created for the same process.

A user can also create a new burger, of thier choosing, by entering the information at the bottom of the page and clicking on the "Add Burger" button. The burgers added by the user are automatically posted to the "eaten" portion of the page, but by using the right button they can be moved to the available side.

Burger Madness is hosted on heroku and offers the user the chance to add as many burgers as they would like. There is also SQL integration with the application, thus a persistent set of burgers is wired in with the application.

While burgers can be added to the application and updated via the buttons, there is currently no delete option available in the application.

An example of the home page for Burger Madness is posted below.
